                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  The I2C HAL driver can be used as follows:

  (#) Declare a I2C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
      I2C_HandleTypeDef  hi2c;

  (#)Initialize the I2C low level resources by implementing the HAL_I2C_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the I2Cx interface clock
      (##) I2C pins configuration
          (+++) Enable the clock for the I2C GPIOs
          (+++) Configure I2C pins as alternate function open-drain
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
          (+++) Configure the I2Cx interrupt priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC I2C IRQ Channel
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
          (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for the transmit or receive channel
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using
          (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx channel
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hi2c DMA Tx or Rx handle
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on 
                the DMA Tx or Rx channel

  (#) Configure the Communication Speed, Duty cycle, Addressing mode, Own Address1,
      Dual Addressing mode, Own Address2, General call and Nostretch mode in the hi2c Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the I2C registers by calling the HAL_I2C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware 
      (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_I2C_MspInit(&hi2c) API.

  (#) To check if target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_I2C_IsDeviceReady()

   *** I2C Workarounds linked to Silicon Limitation ***
   ====================================================
   [..]
     Below the list of all silicon limitations implemented for HAL on STM32F1xx product.
     (@) See ErrataSheet to know full silicon limitation list of your product.

     (#) Workarounds Implemented inside I2C HAL Driver
        (##) Wrong data read into data register (Polling and Interrupt mode)
        (##) Start cannot be generated after a misplaced Stop
        (##) Some software events must be managed before the current byte is being transferred: 
             Workaround: Use DMA in general, except when the Master is receiving a single byte.
             For Interupt mode, I2C should have the highest priority in the application.
        (##) Mismatch on the "Setup time for a repeated Start condition" timing parameter:
             Workaround: Reduce the frequency down to 88 kHz or use the I2C Fast-mode if 
             supported by the slave.
        (##) Data valid time (tVD;DAT) violated without the OVR flag being set:
             Workaround: If the slave device allows it, use the clock stretching mechanism 
             by programming NoStretchMode = I2C_NOSTRETCH_DISABLE in HAL_I2C_Init.\end{DoxyVerb}
